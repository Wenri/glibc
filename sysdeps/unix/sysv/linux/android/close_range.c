/*
 * close_range() wrapper for Android seccomp bypass.
 *
 * The close_range() syscall is blocked by Android's seccomp filter.
 * This wrapper returns ENOSYS directly so that callers (like Python's
 * subprocess module) will fall back to closing file descriptors one by one.
 *
 * Note: This wrapper intercepts the libc close_range() function.
 * Programs that call close_range via syscall() directly will hit the
 * SIGSYS handler in sigaction.c which also returns ENOSYS.
